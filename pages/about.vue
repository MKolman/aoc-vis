    <h1>About Leaderboard Visualiser for Advent of Code</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> is an Advent calendar
      of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels
      that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as
      a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework,
      practice problems, or to challenge each other.

      In addition to a global leaderboard that fills up in about 10 minutes each
      account also has a private leaderboard connected to it. Different people
      solve the problems in different ways and at different times. I thought it
      was interesting enough to plot some graphs on how exactly the solving times
      differ between members of the same leaderboard.
